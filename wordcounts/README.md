Given a text file, output a word frequency count, in descending order of frequency. Normalise for case (so 'the' and 'The' are the same words). The input will already be stripped of punctuation: effectively, it's just a space-separated list of words.

You can test your approach against the attached text file (Moby Dick). You should get the first five results as follows:

the: 14440
of: 6653
and: 6398
a: 4673
to: 4620
